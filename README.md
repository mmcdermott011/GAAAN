#GAAAN
GAAAN is a Generative Album Art Adversarial network that uses the DCGAN architecture to generate unique music album-art images.
This repository contains folders for acquiring the data, training the GAN, and deploying the GAN with a Flask webserver.
###Future Iterations
The plan is to experiment more with training and different architectures to produce more detailed results as well as 
re=implementing the user interface of the web service.
